## Overview

The Slot Booking System is a web-based application that allows users to book time slots for indoor and outdoor games. The system integrates with Google Sign-In for authentication and provides a seamless experience for managing bookings. The backend is powered by Google Apps Script, which interacts with a Google Sheet to store and retrieve data.

Key Features:

- Resets slots automatically between 12 AM and 1 AM for a new day.
- Stores data for the last 7 days only (older data is deleted).
- Users must have an `@northsouth.edu` email to access the system.
- Admins are manually added to the Google Sheet by the owner.
- Admins can cancel any slot, and the user who booked it will receive an email notification.
- Every booking triggers an email confirmation to the user.
- Users can book one slot per day, while admins can book slots for specific time periods.
- Admins can mark slots as "No Available" or "Available."
- Admins can turn off slot booking for a specific day.
